Ex.1 
With padding = 0 Convolution got result .952, when MPL achieve only .857
That says conv is better.

Ex. 2

-At the beginning, pixelation is observed, the colors change sharply within the same filter. By the simplicity of several epochs, sharpness is smoothed out and the general picture becomes more blurred. 
-On 12 epoch I would say that filters are stabalizing.
